# ResultExtractor
This Python script is an automated web scraper designed to fetch the H.S.C. exam results for a specific list of students from the Dinajpur Education Board (result.dinajpurboard.gov.bd)'s result portal. It extracts detailed information for each student, including their personal details, GPA, and a full list of subject-wise marks. The data is then stored in a local SQlite database.
